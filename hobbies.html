    <h3>Hockey</h3>

    <p>I’ve always been into Hockey since I was a baby, quite 
        literally. My dad has been a die hard penguins fan since he was 
        about 20 when his roommate in college got him into the sport. I’ve 
        witnessed 3 Stanley Cup wins and also seen them go to the playoffs 
        every year since I was born until this past year when they lost their
         streak. A little over a year ago I decided I would get into the 
         sport as I played soccer when I was younger. Hockey was more fast 
         paced and felt more competitive to me as I’ve watched my whole life
          and I joined the Troy Bruins club team. I play for varsity on my 
          second year playing and it’s a lot of fun to be able to play a game
           I’ve watched my whole life.

    <h3>Photography</h3>

    <p>Photography - Something I’ve always been interested in is photography.
         I used to want to do it as a career but that never went through
          although I have taken it up as a hobby after my dad got me a free 
          camera from his job. It’s an Olympus EM10 Mark II, it’s a mirrorless
           camera which is a type of digital camera that can take pictures 
           without the mirrored effect, it’s a great camera and I enjoy going
            out and taking pictures around Dayton especially.
