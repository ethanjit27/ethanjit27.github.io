        <p>I plan on taking a gap year to 
            become a Tower Technician (climbing towers legally) with my friend Asher since it requires heavy travel. 
            I plan on becoming a professional hobo or a professional
            pooper. More on that in the Education section.

            I live with my Mom, Dad, and Brother. We currently have 10 pets and 2 fish tanks.
             We have: <ol>
                    <li>6 Cats</li>
                    <li>2 Dogs</li>
                    <li>2 Birds</li>
                    <li>2 Fish Tanks</li>
                      </ol>
             Our two fish tanks are one predator tank (fish that 
              are very aggressive) and one reef tank (friendly fish with lots of coral in the 
              tank).

            During my free time, I enjoy photography, spending time with friends, exploring,
             painting, and playing and watching hockey. I have only recently gotten into 
             photography and painting but I have been watching hockey since I was literally 
             a baby and playing for a little over a year now. I am also interested in 
             Fashion. I like to put effort into what I wear and spend time looking at and
             buying clothes I feel represent my taste. None of my hobbies are illegal.

        <p>
            For work, I work at FC Industries as an intern in the IT department. 
            My day to day tasks are a lot of hardware and sometimes software related tasks.
             I do a lot of Windows computer setups and configure the computers with all of
              the required software by our company. I also will move people's offices and 
              set up them up with new computers and plug everything in.
