    <section class="hobo">
        <p> I go to school at Fairmont High School and I am in the CTC program for IT.
            I am going to pursue the life of a professional hobo. 
            This does not require college. I believe this life over a life in IT is fit for me. 
            I will build huts inside of bushes inside of land owned by my family and create a living.
            As I am a professional hobo, I do not stay at my hut for very long and I venture out.
            For money, I will panhandle (*Panhandling is not illegal in Ohio*). Panhandling is a very profitable career. Pulling
            in an average of $60K per year. My friend Philbert Figglebottom plans to join me on my journey.

    <section class="pooper">
        <p>
            Another lifestyle I might decide to chooce is a professional pooper. You can get paid up to 500 dollars per stool
            as a good pooper and as a fit man myself I believe I can make a very strong living for myself doing this.
            You go through heavy screening to see if you are fit for the position of a professional but you 
            can pass aslong as you are healthy.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="gong">
        <p>
            The third and final lifestyle I may choose, is the famed Gong Farmer. This 
            job dates back past the 19th century. A gong farmer digs out and removes human 
            excrement from privies and cesspits. Many people wish to become a gong farmer but only
            few can make it through the harsh way of becoming one. If I can one day become a gong farmer,
            my life will become complete. In the way of becoming a gong farmer, I will be joined by yet
            another friend, they go by the name of Phillip, Phillip Figglebottom, the half brother to Mr. Philbert
            Figglebottom.
