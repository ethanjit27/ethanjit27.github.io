        <p>I currently play for the Troy Bruins Varsity hockey team. 
            We are a team based out of Troy, Ohio, not related to the Trojans 
            which is the high school team. We play in the CSSHL hockey league 
            (chshl.club). I have been playing for about a year and a half now 
            and it’s been insanely fun. I’ve put about about 6 points so far in
            both seasons as last year I was still learning my positions and how
             to skate to my best ability. I feel a lot better this season and I
              have confidence I will get more goals. My team also just recently went 
              to the championship game in a Thanksgiving tournament at Notre Dame.

        <p>
            I don’t know if I will be 
        able to play in college but some of my previous teammates went to
        Sinclair’s hockey team but they are having trouble getting enough
        players to form a team but they have a solid program, so I will 
        see if it’s still possible by them time I go there.
